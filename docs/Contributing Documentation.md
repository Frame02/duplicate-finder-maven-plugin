The documentation for the duplicate finder plugin is kept in
[its github wiki](https://github.com/basepom/duplicate-finder-maven-plugin/wiki). Unfortunately,
the Github wikis do not support pull requests. Therefore, the Github
Wiki pages are also kept in the
[docs](https://github.com/basepom/duplicate-finder-maven-plugin/tree/master/docs)
folder of the main repository.

If you want to contribute a documentation fix, update or change,
please fork the main repository and send a pull request for the files
in the `docs` folder.
