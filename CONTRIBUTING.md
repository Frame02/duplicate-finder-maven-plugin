**We welcome any contribution, bug report or feature request! Thank you for taking time to contribute back.**

Please review the [Development Guidelines](https://github.com/basepom/duplicate-finder-maven-plugin/wiki/Development%20Guidelines) for a basic outline on how to write code.


If you want to contribute a feature or a larger bug fix: **Thank you**!

However, you can ensure that your feature will be merged and released quickly by

* Have integration tests for your feature. Please review [Writing Integration Tests](https://github.com/basepom/duplicate-finder-maven-plugin/wiki/Writing%20Integration%20Tests)
* Document your feature as described in [Contributing Documentation]((https://github.com/basepom/duplicate-finder-maven-plugin/wiki/Contributing%20Documentation)! Not many people like to write documentation and even fewer like to write documentation for other people's code. If your new feature changes the behavior or adds new options and settings, chances are slim that it will go in quickly if it is not accompanied by the necessary changes to the Wiki pages in the [docs](https://github.com/basepom/duplicate-finder-maven-plugin/tree/master/docs) folder.
